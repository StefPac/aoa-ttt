# AOA-Twenty-Twenty-Twenty ðŸ‘€

This is a small MacOS utility that will display a notification every twenty
minutes to remind users to look for 20 seconds at an object at least 20 feet
away. It is based on a [recommendation by the American Optometric
Association](https://www.aoa.org/AOA/Images/Patients/Eye%20Conditions/20-20-20-rule.pdf).

Your eyes are important, take good care!
